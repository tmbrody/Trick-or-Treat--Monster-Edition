# Trick or Treat (Monster Edition)

This is a game I made last year after finishing a Unity 2D Course. I'm not sure if I'll work on it more in the future, but I am still pretty happy with the look and feel of the game. The game works on my laptop without any issues, but I can't play it on my PC, so there's a good chance that there will be several errors and issues when you run the game unless you are using a very specific setup. That would be the first thing I would fix if I start working on this game again.
